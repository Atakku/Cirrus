Cirrus 0.6.2 is a minor update that officially introduces viewport variants for utility classes. The viewport behavior is now consistent across all supported utility classes. For example, we can make a `div` have `display: block` only for `md` or higher just by adding the `u-block-md` class. The main concept here is that we design for the smallest screen width and only apply the modifications for larger widths (more on this later).

##### 🎉 Features

- This update officially adds support for viewport classes for the following utilities:
  - Clearfix
  - Display
  - Flexbox
  - Position
- Streamline generation of viewport classes for different utilities. These utility classes follow a mobile-first design approach, meaning that something like `u-flex` will allow for all viewports. To change the behavior for `sm`, `md`, `lg`, or `xl`, we would need to apply additional modifier classes (see example below).

  - In this example, here we start with `u-flex` for `xs` to `sm`. For `md` and above, we will use `u-block`.

    ```html
    <div class="u-flex u-block-md">
        <!-- -->
    </div>
    ```

- Classes that apply on buttons such as default button styling, styling buttons in headers, etc. all now use a common selector. [1b6b997](https://github.com/Spiderpig86/Cirrus/commit/1b6b997e239955d792cc0605c61d4a71ef58c0a5)
- New overflow utility classes:
  - u-overflow-overlay
  - u-overflow-revert
  - u-overflow-visible
  - u-overflow-x-scroll
  - u-overflow-y-scroll
- Other refactoring: [0ef030b](https://github.com/Spiderpig86/Cirrus/commit/0ef030b4893c40ff57183e0cecc306aeced4ddb0)
  - Refactored code to extract more hard coded values to variables.
  - Removed usage of prefixed \*-transition properties, not needed according to http://shouldiprefix.com
  - Removed remaining @media declaration in favor of screen-above, screen-below, and screen-between utilities
  - Deprecated `font-italic`
  - Added more group selectors


##### 🐛 Fixes

- Removed excess padding on selects which broke the display in form groups.

##### 💥 Breaking Changes

- Simplified position utility class naming: [9edfab5](https://github.com/Spiderpig86/Cirrus/commit/9edfab5b6c131e18e519e639c8dfbb29dc10707e)
  - `u-position-static` => `u-static`
  - `u-position-fixed` => `u-fixed`
  - `u-position-absolute` => `u-absolute`
  - `u-position-relative` => `u-relative`
  - `u-position-sticky` => `u-sticky`
- Renamed `u-hide-overflow` to `u-overflow-hidden` to be consistent with utility class naming conventions. [5774e4b](https://github.com/Spiderpig86/Cirrus/commit/5774e4bc55f83e13086744b29c4059a582c06621)
- Deprecated `font-italitc`, use `<em></em>` or `<i></i>` instead. [0ef030b](https://github.com/Spiderpig86/Cirrus/commit/0ef030b4893c40ff57183e0cecc306aeced4ddb0)
