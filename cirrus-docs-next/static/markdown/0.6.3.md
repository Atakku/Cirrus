Cirrus 0.6.3 mainly focuses on making existing classes more consistent, fixing existing UI bugs, and introducing some new bigger changes like Tags and viewport support for margin/padding.

In the mean time, I have been working quite hard on [Cirrus Blocks](https://github.com/Cirrus-UI/Cirrus-Blocks) which gives developers a faster way to prototype with Cirrus with a large collection of new components built using Cirrus. You can check out the repository [here](https://github.com/Cirrus-UI/Cirrus-Blocks).
