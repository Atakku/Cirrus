Cirrus 0.6.2 is a minor update that officially introduces viewport variants for utility classes. The viewport behavior is now consistent across all supported utility classes. For example, we can make a `div` have `display: block` only for `md` or higher just by adding the `u-block-md` class. The main concept here is that we design for the smallest screen width and only apply the modifications for larger widths (more on this later).
